Anyone interested in developing software is welcome to attend a Programming Club meeting.

We are meeting remotely on Discord all summer. Check the discord for the latest meeting time; likely Sundays at 5:00 pm.

Last semester, we meet on Tuesdays at 11:00 am in Coover 115 on the PennWest campus, but we may be changing to an Eberly location for Fall of 2023.
